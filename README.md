# HKU TokenFlow
An Initiative of a Token-based Ecosystem in HKU.

## Project Aims
We aim to build a token-based ecosystem at The University of Hong Kong (HKU) using blockchain technology. We named this system ‚ÄúHKU TokenFlow‚Äù. With this system, students can earn digital tokens by joining in campus activities. These might include attending university events, taking part in student clubs, or even completing certain academic tasks. Students can then use these tokens at places like the canteen, Uprint, the HKU gift store, or to purchase tickets for concerts and other events. This setup gives them a real, practical reason to get involved.

The project also has an educational goal: helping students learn about blockchain technology. When they use the system, they will get hands-on experience with things like digital wallets, smart contracts, and decentralized networks‚Äîall within HKU‚Äôs secure environment. It is a chance to learn by doing. Rather than just studying blockchain in theory, they will see it work every time they earn or spend a token.
